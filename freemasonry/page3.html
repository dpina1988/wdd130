                    <p><b>What is Freemasonry?</b> - Freemasonry is a philosophical, philanthropic, educational, and
                        progressive institution.</p>
                    <p><b>Why is it Philosophical?</b> -It is philosophical because its acts and ceremonies deal with
                        the
                        essence, properties, and effects of natural causes. It investigates the laws of nature and
                        relates the first bases of morality and pure ethics.</p>
                    <p><b>Why is it Philanthropic?</b> - It is philanthropic because it is not constituted to obtain
                        personal
                        profit for any class. On the contrary, its collections and resources are destined for the
                        welfare of mankind, without distinction of nationality, sex, religion, or race. Furthermore, it
                        seeks to achieve men's happiness through spiritual elevation and peace of conscience.</p>
                    <p><b>Why is it Progressive?</b> - It is progressive because, starting from the principle of
                        immortality
                        and the belief in a regular and infinite creative principle, it does not cling to dogmas,
                        prejudices, or superstitions. And it does not put any obstacle to the efforts of human beings in
                        the search for truth, nor does it recognize any other limit to this search than that of reason
                        based on science.</p>
                    <p><b>What are its principles?</b> - The freedom of individuals and human groups, be they
                        institutions,
                        races, or nations; the equality of rights and obligations of beings and groups without
                        distinguishing religion, race, or nationality; the brotherhood of all men, since we are all
                        children of the same CREATOR and, therefore, human; and as a consequence, the brotherhood among
                        all nations.</p>
                    <p><b>What is Freemasonry's motto?</b> - Science - Justice - Work: Science, to enlighten the spirits
                        and
                        elevate them; Justice, to balance and enhance human relations; and work, through which men
                        dignify themselves and become economically independent. In a word, Freemasonry works for the
                        intellectual, moral, and social improvement of mankind.</p>
                    <p><b>What is its goal?</b> - Its goal is the investigation of truth, the examination of morality,
                        and the
                        practice of virtues.</p>
                    <p><b>What does Freemasonry mean by morality?</b> - Moral is, for Freemasonry, a science based on
                        human
                        understanding. The natural and universal law governs all rational and free beings. It is the
                        scientific demonstration of conscience. And this fabulous science teaches us our duties and the
                        reason for using our rights. By penetrating morality into the depths of our souls, we feel the
                        triumph of truth and justice.</p>
                    <p><b>What does Freemasonry understand by virtue?</b> - Freemasonry understands that virtue is the
                        strength
                        to do good in its broadest sense; it is the fulfillment of our duties to society and our family
                        without personal interest. In summary: virtue does not recoil from sacrifice or even death when
                        fulfilling the duty.</p>
                    <p><b>What does Freemasonry understand by duty?</b> - Freemasonry understands by duty the respect
                        and
                        rights of individuals and society. But it is not enough just to respect property; we must also
                        protect and serve our fellow men. Freemasonry summarizes the duty of man as follows: "Respect
                        for God, love for your neighbor, and dedication to your family. Indeed, this is the greatest
                        synthesis of universal brotherhood.</p>
                    <p><b>Is Freemasonry religious?</b> - Yes, it is religious because it recognizes the existence of a
                        single
                        creative, regulating, absolute, supreme, and infinite principle, which is called the GREAT
                        ARCHITECT OF THE UNIVERSE because it is a spiritualist entity in opposition to the predominance
                        of materialism. These factors, which are essential and indispensable for a truly religious and
                        logical interpretation of the UNIVERSE, form the basis and the great guidelines of all Masonic
                        ideology and activity.</p>
                    <p><b>Is Freemasonry a religion?</b> - No. Freemasonry is not a religion. It is a society that aims
                        to
                        unite men among themselves. Reciprocal union, in the broadest and highest sense of the term. And
                        in its effort to unite men, it admits in its bosom people of all religious creeds without any
                        distinction.</p>
                    <p><b>To be a Freemason, is it necessary to renounce the religion to which one belongs?</b> - No,
                        because
                        Freemasonry shelters in its bosom men of any religion, as long as they believe in only one
                        Creator, the GREAT ARCHITECT OF THE UNIVERSE, which is God. Generally, there is this belief
                        among Catholics, but illustrious prelates have belonged to the Masonic Order; among others, Cura
                        Hidalgo, Paladin of Mexican Freedom; Father Calvo, founder of Freemasonry in Central America;
                        the Archbishop of Venezuela, Don Ramon Ignácio Mendez; Father Diogo Antonio Feijó; Canons Luiz
                        Vieira, José da Silva de Oliveira Rolin, of the Inconfidência Mineira, Friar Miguelino, Friar
                        Caneca, and many others.</p>
                    <p><b>What other distinguished men were Masons?</b> - Philosophers like Voltaire, Goethe, and
                        Lessing;
                        Musicians like Beethoven, Haydn, and Mozart; Military men like Frederick the Great, Napoleon,
                        and Garibaldi; Poets like Byron, Lamartine, and Hugo; Writers like Castellar, Mazzini, and
                        Espling.</p>
                    <p><b>Were there illustrious Freemasons only in Europe?</b> - No. They existed in America too. The
                        liberators of America were all Masons. Washington in the United States; Miranda, the South
                        American Freedom Father; San Martin and O'Higgins in Argentina; Bolivar in North South America;
                        Marti in Cuba; Benito Juarez in Mexico and Emperor Dom Pedro I in Brazil.</p>
                    <p><b>What prominent names in Brazil were Masons?</b> -D. Pedro I, José Bonifácio, Gonçalves Lêdo,
                        Luis
                        Alves de Lima e Silva (Duque de Caxias), Deodoro da Fonseca, Floriano Peixoto, Prudente de
                        Morais, Campos Salles, Rodrigues Alves, Nilo Peçanha, Hermes da Fonseca, Wenceslau Braz,
                        Washington Luiz, Rui Barbosa, and many others.</p>
                    <p><b>So Freemasonry is tolerant?</b> - Freemasonry is eminently tolerant and demands the broadest
                        tolerance from its members. It respects the. Political opinions and religious beliefs of all
                        men, recognizing that all religions and political ideals are equally respectable and reject all
                        pretensions of granting privileged status to any particular one.</p>
                    <p><b>What does Freemasonry fight?</b> - Ignorance, superstition, fanaticism. Pride, intemperance,
                        vice,
                        discord, domination, and privilege.</p>
                    <p><b>Is Freemasonry a secret society?</b> - No, for the simple reason that its existence is widely
                        known.
                        It has been granted legal personality by the authorities of several countries. Its purposes are
                        widely spread in dictionaries, encyclopedias, history books, etc. The only secret that exists
                        and is not known except by joining the institution is the means to recognize the Masons among
                        themselves, in any part of the world, and the way to interpret their symbols and the teachings
                        contained in them.</p>
                    <p><b>What are the indispensable individual conditions to be able to belong to Freemasonry?</b> - To
                        believe in the existence of a Creator principle; to be a free man with good morals; to be
                        conscious of his duties to his country, his fellow men, and himself; to have a lawful and
                        honorable profession or trade that allows him to provide for his personal needs and those of his
                        family, and to support the works of the institution.</p>
                    <p><b>What is required of Freemasons?</b> - In principle, everything that is required to join any
                        other
                        institution: respect for its statutes, regulations, and obedience to the resolutions of the
                        majority, taken according to the principles that govern them; love for the Homeland; respect for
                        the legally constituted governments; obedience to the laws of the country where you live, etc.
                        And in particular: keeping the secrecy of the Masonic rituals; correct and dignified conduct
                        inside and outside Masonry; dedicating part of your time to attend Masonic meetings; the
                        practice of morality, equality, and human solidarity and justice in all its fullness. Moreover,
                        it strictly forbids inside the institution political and religious discussions, because it
                        prefers a broad base of understanding among men in order to avoid that they are divided by small
                        issues of civil life.</p>
                    <p><b>What is a Masonic Temple?</b> - It is a place where Masons gather periodically to practice the
                        ritualistic ceremonies they are allowed in a fraternal and favorable environment to concentrate
                        their attention and efforts to improve their character and their spiritual life, and to develop
                        their sense of responsibility, making them calmly meditate on man's mission in life, constantly
                        reminding them of the eternal values whose cultivation will enable them to get closer to the
                        truth.</p>
                    <p><b>What do you get from being a Freemason?</b> - The possibility of perfecting oneself, of
                        learning, of
                        disciplining oneself, of living with people who, by their words and deeds, can become examples
                        and find fraternal affection wherever one is, inside or outside the country. Finally, the
                        enormous satisfaction of having contributed, even in a small part, to the moral and great Work
                        carried out by men. Freemasonry only considers progress possible on the basis of respect for
                        personality, social justice, and the closest solidarity among men. It displays its motto,
                        "Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity," with the abstention of political and religious flags. The
                        Masonic secret, which in bad faith and slanderously has been used by its enemies to make it
                        suspect among the candid or decadent spirits, is not a dogma but a procedure, a guarantee, a
                        necessary and legitimate defense, but as has inevitably happened with every right and its
                        correlative duty, the precept of Masonic reservations have already experienced its evolution
                        through time and according to the countries. Freemasonry has no prejudice of powers and does not
                        admit in its bosom people who do not have a minimum culture that allows them to practice their
                        feelings and have a profession or income with which they can attend to the needs of their
                        families, face the expenses of the society and help the needy.</p>
