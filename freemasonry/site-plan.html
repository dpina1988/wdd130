    <h3>History of the Adonhiramite Rite</h3>
    <p>
    <h3>Brief history of the Adonhiramite Rite and its relationship with Brazil</h3>
    </p>
    <p>
      Mystical, spiritual, historical, orthodox and traditional. Many are the adjectives used to define the Adonhiramite
      Rite.
      Defining its origins and history is as difficult as it is passionate and challenging. For a variety of reasons,
      the dedicated
      literature is quite scarce, and documents relating to the early days of its practice are quite rare.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Adonhiramite Rite is defined by many authors as preserving its original essence, keeping ritualistic
      traditions and initiatic
      practices of the mystery schools of antiquity, and of the ordinances of the operative period of Freemasonry. It is
      metaphysical,
      theistic, esoteric, and mystical. The Adonhiramite Rite is the result of the evolution and improvement of the
      Kilwinning, York,
      and Clermont Rites, practiced by British Lodges, and, above all, of the unfolding of the Heredon Rite (Mystic
      Mount), also called
      the Perfection Rite, originating in Scotland and widely practiced in France in the 18th century.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the Adonhiramite Rite did not absorb the Jacobite concepts inserted by the exiles in France from the
      Scottish lineage of
      the Stuarts, adopting the concepts of English Freemasonry, particularly of the current called Moderns, after the
      foundation of the
      Grand Lodge of London and Westminster in 1717.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of that, Oscar Argollo, Masonic author of the first decades of the 20th century, classifies the
      Adonhiramite Rite as one
      of the oldest, associating its origin to a ritual from 1248, used by the builders of the Cologne Cathedral,
      Germany, which he called
      the Primitive Rite of Egypt, from which the Adonhiramite rituals would have originated. He also claims that there
      is evidence of the
      practice of the Adonhiramite Rite in 1616. In fact, even if these somewhat surprising statements are true, this
      Rite certainly did not
      bear the name Adonhiramite.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prior to 1750, when the explosion of Rites occurred in France, mainland Freemasonry had the same practice as in
      the British Isles, that
      is, there were rituals with differences between them, but not Rites as we know them today.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1781, the ritualist Louis Guillemain de Saint-Victor published in Philadelphia, USA, the first volume of the
      work entitled Recueil Précieux
      de la Maçonnerie Adonhiramite, Precious Compilation of Adonhiramite Freemasonry in our language, which dealt with
      the three Degrees of Symbolism
      nd the Perfect Master Degree. Later he published the second volume containing from Degree Five to Twelve, the
      latter corresponding to the Rose-Cross Knight Degree,
      which he classified as nec plus ultra, Latin expression meaning nothing is beyond. This is considered the
      reference work of the Adonhiramite Rite.
    </p>
    <h3>The Degrees of the Rite</h3>
    <p>
      The first edition of the two volume Precious Compilation of Adonhiramite Freemasonry postulated the following
      hierarchy of Degrees, divided from 1 to 4 in the first
      volume and from 5 to 13 in the second:
    </p>
    <ol start="01">
      <li>Apprentice Mason</li>
      <li>Companion Freemason</li>
      <li>Master Mason</li>
      <li>Perfect Master</li>
      <li>First Elected or Elected of Nine</li>
      <li>Second Elect or Elect of Perignan</li>
      <li>Third Elect or Elect of the Fifteen</li>
      <li>Small Architect</li>
      <li>Grand Architect or Scottish Companion</li>
      <li>Scottish Master</li>
      <li>Knight of the Sword, of the East or of the Eagle</li>
      <li>Knight Rose-Cross</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      It happens, however, that in this second volume of the Precious Compilation, a translation of a German ritual was
      published, which had previously been in the Journal of
      Trevoux, referring to the ancient Order of the Noachite or Prussian Knights, translated into French by De Bérage,
      which suggested the existence of a thirteenth Degree and
      caused an enormous controversy regarding the number of Degrees originally practiced by the Adonhiramite Rite.
      Examination of the Saint-Victor texts reveals the possibility that it was a kind of honorific degree, for it was a
      sinequa non condition to be decorated with it that the
      Master Mason had the Rose-Cross Knight degree, i.e., the degree actually existed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact is that for a long time the Adonhiramite Rite was known as the Rite of Thirteen Degrees and its
      practitioners called Noachite Knights. The first Adonhiramite Rite
      published in Brazilian soil, by the Grand Orient of Brazil, in 1836, had this configuration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since its formalization, the Adonhiramite Rite gained many followers in France, but the social upheaval the
      country was going through in that decade progressively led to its decline.
      Certainly the religiosity of the Adonhiramite Rite, theistic and with a strong Christian influence, called the
      attention of the Portuguese freemasons, the largest Catholic nation in
      Europe at the time, causing it to migrate to the Lusitanian lands and its colonies, where it had more acceptance,
      among them Brazil.
    </p>
    <h3>The Adonhiramite Rite in Brazil</h3>
    <p>
      However, there are records of the practice of the Adonhiramite Rite in a previous period, between 1813 and 1815,
      in what was the first embryo of a Brazilian Masonic Power founded in
      Salvador, Bahia. In this sense, the Museum of the United Grand Lodge of England - GLUI, has in its collection an
      Adonhiramite ritual translated by Hipólito José da Costa, perhaps the
      most prominent Brazilian Freemason in Europe in the XIX century, which proves in a documental way the practice of
      the Adonhiramite Rite in Brazil even before we became an independent nation.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the foundation of the Grand Orient of Brazil, on June 17th, 1822, the Adonhiramite Rite remains being
      practiced here in a regular way and enjoys a period of ample growth, notably after
      the foundation of the Grande Oriente do Vale dos Beneditinos, or Grande Oriente do Passeio, whose Lodges would
      later be integrated to the Grand Orient of Brazil. In 2010 the Adonhiramite Rite
      makes its way back to Europe, where it originated, and starts being practiced again in Portugal.

    <h3>FAQ about Freemasonry</h3>
    <p>
      What is Freemasonry?
      - Freemasonry is an essentially philosophical, philanthropic, educational and progressive institution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why is it Philosophical?
      -It is philosophical because in its acts and ceremonies it deals with the essence, properties, and effects of
      natural causes. It investigates the laws of nature and relates the first bases
      of morality and pure ethics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why is it Philanthropic?
      - It is philanthropic because it is not constituted to obtain personal profit for any class. On the contrary, its
      collections and resources are destined for the welfare of mankind, without
      distinction of nationality, sex, religion, or race. It seeks to achieve men's happiness through spiritual
      elevation and peace of conscience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why is it Progressive?
      - It is progressive because, starting from the principle of immortality and the belief in a regular and infinite
      creative principle, it does not cling to dogmas, prejudices, or superstitions.
      And it does not put any obstacle to the efforts of human beings in the search for truth, nor does it recognize any
      other limit to this search than that of reason based on science.
    </p>
    <p>
      What are its principles?
      - The freedom of individuals and human groups, be they institutions, races, or nations; the equality of rights and
      obligations of beings and groups without distinguishing religion, race, or
      nationality; the brotherhood of all men, since we are all children of the same CREATOR and, therefore, human; and
      as a consequence, the brotherhood among all nations.
    </p>
    <p>
      What is Freemasonry's motto?
      - Science - Justice - Work: Science, to enlighten the spirits and elevate them; Justice, to balance and enhance
      human relations; and Work, through which men dignify themselves and become
      economically independent. In a word, Freemasonry works for the intellectual, moral, and social improvement of
      mankind.
    </p>
    <p>
      What is its goal?
      - Its goal is the investigation of truth, the examination of morality, and the practice of virtues.
    </p>
    <p>
      What does Freemasonry mean by morality?
      - Moral is for Freemasonry a science based on human understanding. It is the natural and universal law that
      governs all rational and free beings. It is the scientific demonstration of conscience.
      And this wonderful science teaches us our duties and the reason for the use of our rights. By penetrating morality
      into the depths of our souls we feel the triumph of truth and justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      What does Freemasonry understand by virtue?
      - Freemasonry understands that virtue is the strength to do good in its widest sense; it is the fulfillment of our
      duties to society and to our family without personal interest. In summary: virtue
      does not recoil from sacrifice or even death when it comes to the fulfillment of duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      What does Freemasonry understand by duty?
      - Freemasonry understands by duty the respect and rights of individuals and society. But it is not enough just to
      respect property, we must also protect and serve our fellow men. Freemasonry
      summarizes the duty of man as follows: "Respect for God, love for your neighbor, and dedication to your family.
      Indeed, this is the greatest synthesis of universal brotherhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is Freemasonry religious?
      - Yes, it is religious, because it recognizes the existence of a single creative, regulating, absolute, supreme
      and infinite principle which is called the GREAT ARCHITECT OF THE UNIVERSE,
      because it is a spiritualist entity in opposition to the predominance of materialism. These factors, which are
      essential and indispensable for a truly religious and logical interpretation of the UNIVERSE,
      form the basis and the great guidelines of all Masonic ideology and activity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is Freemasonry a religion?
      - No. Freemasonry is not a religion. It is a society that aims to unite men among themselves. Reciprocal union, in
      the broadest and highest sense of the term. And in its effort to unite men, it admits in
      its bosom people of all religious creeds without any distinction.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be a Freemason, is it necessary to renounce the religion to which one belongs?
      - No, because Freemasonry shelters in its bosom men of any religion, as long as they believe in only one Creator,
      the GREAT ARCHITECT OF THE UNIVERSE, which is God. Generally there is this belief among Catholics,
      but illustrious prelates have belonged to the Masonic Order; among others, Cura Hidalgo, Paladin of Mexican
      Freedom; Father Calvo, founder of Freemasonry in Central America; the Archbishop of Venezuela, Don Ramon Ignácio
      Mendez;
      Father Diogo Antonio Feijó; Canons Luiz Vieira, José da Silva de Oliveira Rolin, of the Inconfidência Mineira,
      Friar Miguelino, Friar Caneca, and many others.
    </p>
    <p>
      What other distinguished men were Masons?
      - Philosophers like Voltaire, Goethe and Lessing; Musicians like Beethoven, Haydn and Mozart; Military men like
      Frederick the Great, Napoleon and Garibaldi; Poets like Byron, Lamartine and Hugo; Writers like Castellar, Mazzini
      and Espling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only in Europe were there illustrious Freemasons?
      - No. They existed in America too. The liberators of America were all Masons. Washington in the United States;
      Miranda, the South American Freedom Father; San Martin and O`Higgins in Argentina; Bolivar in North South America;
      Marti in Cuba;
      Benito Juarez in Mexico and Emperor Dom Pedro I in Brazil.
    </p>
    <p>
      What prominent names in Brazil were Masons?
      -D. Pedro I, José Bonifácio, Gonçalves Lêdo, Luis Alves de Lima e Silva (Duque de Caxias), Deodoro da Fonseca,
      Floriano Peixoto, Prudente de Morais, Campos Salles, Rodrigues Alves, Nilo Peçanha, Hermes da Fonseca, Wenceslau
      Braz, Washington Luiz,
      Rui Barbosa and many others.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Freemasonry is tolerant?
      - Freemasonry is eminently tolerant and demands the broadest tolerance from its members. It respects the.
      Political opinions and religious beliefs of all men, recognizing that all religions and political ideals are
      equally respectable and reject
      all pretensions of granting privileged status to any particular one.
    </p>
    <p>
      What does Freemasonry fight?
      - Ignorance, superstition, fanaticism. Pride, intemperance, vice, discord, domination, and privilege.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is Freemasonry a secret society?
      - No, for the simple reason that its existence is widely known. It has been granted legal personality by the
      authorities of several countries. Its purposes are widely spread in dictionaries, encyclopedias, history books,
      etc. The only secret that
      exists and is not known except by joining the institution, are the means to recognize the Masons among themselves,
      in any part of the world, and the way to interpret their symbols and the teachings contained in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      What are the indispensable individual conditions to be able to belong to Freemasonry?
      - To believe in the existence of a Creator principle; to be a free man with good morals; to be conscious of his
      duties to his country, his fellow men, and himself; to have a lawful and honorable profession or trade that allows
      him to provide for his
      personal needs and those of his family, and to support the works of the Institution.
    </p>
    <p>
      What is required of Freemasons?
      - In principle, everything that is required to join any other institution: respect for its statutes, regulations,
      and obedience to the resolutions of the majority, taken according to the principles that govern them; love for the
      Homeland; respect for
      the legally constituted governments; obedience to the laws of the country where you live, etc. And in particular:
      keeping the secrecy of the Masonic rituals; correct and dignified conduct inside and outside Masonry; dedicating
      part of your time to attend
      Masonic meetings; the practice of morality, equality, and human solidarity and justice in all its fullness.
      Moreover, it strictly forbids inside the institution, political and religious discussions, because it prefers a
      broad base of understanding among men in order to avoid that they are divided by small issues of civil life.
    </p>
    <p>
      What is a Masonic Temple?
      - It is a place where Masons gather periodically to practice the ritualistic ceremonies they are allowed, in a
      fraternal and favorable environment to concentrate their attention and efforts to improve their character, and
      their spiritual life, and to develop their sense of responsibility, making them calmly meditate on man's
      mission in life, constantly reminding them of the eternal values whose cultivation will enable them to get closer
      to the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      What do you get from being a Freemason?
      - The possibility of perfecting oneself, of learning, of disciplining oneself, of living with people who, by their
      words and deeds, can become examples and find fraternal affection wherever one is, inside or outside the country.
      Finally, the enormous satisfaction of having contributed, even in a small part, to the moral and great
      work carried out by men. Freemasonry only considers progress possible on the basis of respect for personality,
      social justice, and the closest solidarity among men. It displays its motto "Liberty, Equality and Fraternity"
      with the abstention of political and religious flags. The Masonic secret, which in bad faith and slanderously
      has been used by its enemies to make it suspect among the candid or decadent spirits, is not a dogma but a
      procedure, a guarantee, a necessary and legitimate defense, but as has inevitably happened with every right and
      its correlative duty, the precept of Masonic reservations has already experienced its evolution through time and
      according to the countries. Freemasonry has no prejudice of powers, and does not admit in its bosom, people who do
      not have a minimum of culture that allows them to practice their feelings and have a profession or income with
      which they can attend to the needs of their families, face the expenses of the society and help the needy.
