                    <p>Mystical, spiritual, historical, orthodox, and traditional. Many are the adjectives used to
                        define the Adonhiramite Rite. Explaining its origins and history is as complex as it is
                        passionate and challenging. For various reasons, the dedicated literature is relatively scarce,
                        and documents relating to the early days of its practice are rare.</p>

                    <p>Many authors define the Adonhiramite Rite as preserving its original essence, keeping ritualistic
                        traditions and initiatic practices of the mystery schools of antiquity and the ordinances of the
                        operative period of Freemasonry. It is metaphysical, theistic, esoteric, and mystical. The
                        Adonhiramite Rite is the result of the evolution and improvement
                        of the Kilwinning, York, and Clermont Rites, practiced by British Lodges, and, above all, of the
                        unfolding of the Heredon Rite (Mystic Mount), also called the Perfection Rite, originating in
                        Scotland and widely practiced in France in the 18th century.</p>

                    <p>However, the Adonhiramite Rite did not absorb the Jacobite concepts inserted by the exiles in
                        France from the Scottish lineage of the Stuarts, adopting the ideas of English Freemasonry,
                        particularly of the current called Moderns, after the foundation of the Grand Lodge of London
                        and Westminster in 1717. Despite that, Oscar Argollo, Masonic author
                        of the first decades of the 20th century, classifies the Adonhiramite Rite as one of the oldest,
                        associating its origin to a ritual from 1248, used by the builders of the Cologne Cathedral,
                        Germany, which he called the Primitive Rite of Egypt, from which the Adonhiramite rituals would
                        have originated. He also claims that there is evidence of the practice
                        of the Adonhiramite Rite in 1616. However, even if these somewhat surprising statements are
                        factual, this Rite certainly did not bear the name Adonhiramite.</p>

                    <p>Before 1750, when the explosion of Rites occurred in France, mainland Freemasonry had the same
                        practice as in the British Isles; there were rituals with differences between them, but not
                        Rites as we know them today. In 1781, the ritualist Louis Guillemain de Saint-Victor published
                        in Philadelphia, USA, the first volume of the work entitled Recueil
                        Précieux de la Maçonnerie Adonhiramite, Precious Compilation of Adonhiramite Freemasonry in our
                        language, which dealt with the three Degrees of Symbolism and the Perfect Master Degree. Later
                        he published the second volume from Degree Five to Twelve, the latter corresponding to the
                        Rose-Cross Knight Degree, which he classified as nec plus ultra, a Latin
                        expression meaning nothing is beyond. This is considered the reference work of the Adonhiramite
                        Rite.

                    <p>The first edition of the two-volume Precious Compilation of Adonhiramite Freemasonry postulated
                        the
                        following hierarchy of Degrees, divided from 1 to 4 in the first volume and from 5 to 13 in the
                        second:

                    <ol>
                        <li>Apprentice Mason</li>
                        <li>Companion Freemason</li>
                        <li>Master Mason</li>
                        <li>Perfect Master</li>
                        <li>First Elected or Elected of Nine</li>
                        <li>Second Elect or Elect of Perignan</li>
                        <li>Third Elect or Elect of the Fifteen</li>
                        <li>Small Architect</li>
                        <li>Grand Architect or Scottish Companion</li>
                        <li>Scottish Master</li>
                        <li>Knight of the Sword, of the East, or of the Eagle</li>
                        <li>Knight Rose-Cross</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>It happens, however, that in this second volume of the Precious Compilation, a translation of a
                        German ritual was published, which had previously been in the Journal of Trevoux, referring to
                        the
                        ancient Order of the Noachite or Prussian Knights, translated into French by De Bérage, which
                        suggested the existence of a thirteenth Degree and caused an enormous controversy regarding the
                        number of Degrees initially practiced by the Adonhiramite Rite. Examination of the Saint-Victor
                        texts reveals the possibility that it was a kind of honorific degree, for it was a sinequa non
                        condition to be decorated with it that Master Mason had the Rose-Cross Knight degree, i.e., the
                        degree existed.</p>

                    <p>For a long time, the Adonhiramite Rite was known as the Rite of Thirteen Degrees, and its
                        practitioners were called Noachite Knights. The first Adonhiramite Rite published in Brazilian
                        soil,
                        by the Grand Orient of Brazil, in 1836 had this configuration.
                        Since its formalization, the Adonhiramite Rite gained many followers in France, but the social
                        upheaval the country was going through in that decade progressively led to its decline.
                        Certainly,
                        the religiosity of the Adonhiramite Rite, theistic and with a strong Christian influence, caught
                        the
                        attention of the Portuguese freemasons, the largest Catholic nation in Europe at the time,
                        causing
                        it to migrate to the Lusitanian lands and its colonies, where it had more acceptance, among them
                        Brazil.
