    <p>Hi everyone!</p>

    <p>And here we go for another semester. My name is Diego Pina and I'm from Duque de Caxias - Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
        I am married and
        have a fantastic family (as you can see in the picture above).
        My two daughters are worth 10 children at home. I work with Information Security and I am taking the WDD 130
        course as a prerequisite for one of the core courses.
    </p>
    <p>I had to delay my graduation by 02 years because of COVID-19: in 2021 I was in the ICU for 02 months, eight days
        of that being intubated. I acquired many sequels, one of which was the momentary loss of movement in my legs.
        Today (one year and six months later) I still feel constant pain in my legs and I can't move the toes of my left
        foot and completely the right foot, as well as I can't walk properly, run or jump.
    </p>
    <p>
        I took this class last semester until week 08. However, due to health issues linked again to COVID-19, I could
        not complete the assignments for weeks 09, 10, 11, 12, 13, and got an F grade. Therefore, I am taking this
        class again.
    </p>
    <p>I am happy to be with my family, doing my best to live the gospel. I hope everyone has a great semester!
    </p>
